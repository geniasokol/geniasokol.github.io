<h3>General-purpose resources:</h3>
<p>Every translator has their favorite general purpose dictionary. For the sake of speed and efficiency, I usually use an online resource, such as <a href="wordreference.com">WordReference</a> or <a href="multitran.ru">Мультитран</a>. WordReference has a larger library of languages available and is centered around English, but their Russian forum is underused. If you are looking for something more specific, idiomatic, or otherwise harder to translate, Multitran is more likely to have an entry for it, as well as in-line commentary from users about nuances of meaning and usage.</p>
<p>But even Multitran has trouble with full-length idioms, as do all dictionaries, online or print. Even if you think your specialization only works with formal or academic styles, remember that you never know when you might come across conversational language&mdash;in direct speech, or a bit of author creativity. One way out of a troublesome idiom is a lengthy Google search, but if you have the chance, I would recommend getting Sophia Lubensky's <em>Russian-English Dictionary of Idioms</em> for your translation library. As a finite volume, it will not have every idiom, but for the majority of sayings you come across, it can save you five or ten minutes that can be put to better use.</p>
<p>Another unique resource worth mentioning is <a href="linguee.com">Linguee</a>, a multilingual search engine for phrases in context. For any phrase, it will show you its context in an original document and its translated counterpart. Linguee’s database of parallel texts contains a large percentage of legal and official documents, so it’s a good place to look for standardized, conventional formulas often found in such texts. Be careful, however: not all of Linguee’s translations are edited to avoid translatese, so make sure that the translation the parallel texts provide is also found in texts first written in the target language.</p>
