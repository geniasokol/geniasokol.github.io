<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p><strong>Need something translated from Russian to English?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can help!</strong> I have been translating professionally for about five years and have an M.A. in Translation from Kent State University. With my native command of both Russian and English, combined with a strong background in translation theory and practice, I have a unique advantage in providing high-quality translations with fast turnaround times. I also provide several related services, such as certification, editing, transcription, and formatting.</p>
<p>I am a voting member of the American Translators Association and am <a href="http://atanet.org/listing/18052">listed in their directory</a>. I have passed the ATA Certification Exam for Russian to English and am active in the Slavic Language Division.</p>
<p>I work with both agencies and direct clients. If you think you might have a project for me, please feel free to contact me - contact info is listed on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}contact/index.html">Contact</a> page. I look forward to working with you!</p>
<p>P.S. You are also welcome to check out my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}blog/index.html">blog</a>!</p>
