<h2>Qualifications</h2>
<p>Read this page in <a href="Quals_ru.html">Russian</a> (по-русски).
<p>Some people have trouble believing that I can be natively fluent in two languages. In fact, my story is quite simple: I was born in Russia, and Russian is my first language, but at the age of 4 I was brought to the United States, so I was also able to acquire English natively. The hard part came later: maintaining Russian in an English-speaking society. A strict regimen of no English in the home, weekly lessons in Russian language and literature, and constant exposure to Russian and Soviet music and film, as well as one-on-one tutoring in high school, seems to have done the trick.<p>
